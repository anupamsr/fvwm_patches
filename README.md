This repository is supposed to be a central point for all the fvwm related
unofficial patches. (Because I was tired of hunting it all over the internet.)

Specific versions of fvwm are used as tags here, so you can download a tag for
your version and apply those patches.

None of the patches were written by me. This is just a repository which uses
git because it is awesome in maintaining patches ;p
